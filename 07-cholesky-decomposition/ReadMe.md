# Exercise 1: Matrix-vector multiplication - Naive approach[^1]

## Goal:

The purpose of this exercise is to implement Cholesky decomposition on FPGAs. 

## Instructions:

- move to subdirectory:
```console
$ cd 07-cholesky-decomposition
```
- build the application 

```console
$ ./compile.sh sw_emu # or hw_emu for hw emulation
```console

- Run the application:
```console
$ ./run.sh sw_emu #or hw_emu for hw emulation
```

- Analyze the results:

On SLING NSC cluster: 

```console
. /ceph/grid/software/xilinx/tools/Vitis/2023.1/settings64.sh
vitis_analyzer ./build/
```
On IT4I CS cluster: 

```console
. /tools/Xilinx/Vitis/2023.1/settings64.sh
vitis_analyzer ./build/
```

- Run the Vitis HLS:

```console
./run_hls.sh
```

- After a successful synthesis, you can locate the results in the file.

```sh linenums="1"
./build/proj-CHO-DEC/solution/syn/report/cynth.rpt 
```
